# Jordan C Cox

I use this repo as storage for scripts, small tools, and snippets I’ve built over the years. When I find a repeatable pattern or solve a niche problem, I park a cleaned‑up version here so I (and sometimes others) can reuse it later.

## Languages Used
- VBA
- T‑SQL
- PowerShell
- XSLT
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Python (in progress; experimenting in new scripts)

## Latest Projects
- HRIS migration cleanup scripts for Eightfold.AI  
  Notes: still stabilizing; will share more publicly once I’m comfortable they’re robust. I’m also using this work to learn more Python and GitHub.

- Playing with new features on our travel blog https://awayfrommydesk-jordan.blogspot.com/
  Notes: Sidebar widgets such as a travel map that links to an interactive map of geotagged posts and my flickr feed.

- Printhead Maintainer – paper source/tray selection  
  Repo: https://github.com/jordancox7483/PrintheadMaintainer  
  Notes: personal project to add the ability to select the printer’s paper source. Also an excuse to learn a tiny bit of C# / C++.

## Notes
- Most items are self‑contained and meant to be read/used as examples. Environments differ, so treat them as starting points and adapt as needed.
